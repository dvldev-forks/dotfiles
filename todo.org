* TODO Figure out how I can combine multile subdirectories using stow
* TODO Get my htop config in
* TODO Setup VIM Theme
* TODO Setup basic vim customizations
* TODO Add vim to stow
* Get IRC setup
* TODO Secret managment
** Get my work projects setup in spacemacs

The ultimate plan:

* Could go ultra minimal
* Could lean into ascii art
