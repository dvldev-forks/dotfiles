* TODO Move .spacemacs to org babel
** https://github.com/ale-batt/dotspacemacs/edit/master/ale-batt.org
* TODO Secret managment
** Get my work projects setup in spacemacs
** It seems like a good way to do this would just be with a private repo that you deploy seperatly
** get org file dir going with deft support
** The private repo this draws against could be pulled via an optional ansible call, ie deploy --secret-repo http:://somesecretrepo.com/repo

* TODO Theme MC
* Get a /bin directory going

* The ultimate plan:
** Could go ultra minimal
** Could lean into ascii art

* The feature list:
** Matching themes for:
*** tmux
*** zsh
*** spacemacs
*** vim
** Theme based on console colors
** Deployable via ANSIBLE
** Optional secrets repository deployment
