* VIM
** TODO Setup VIM Theme
** TODO Setup basic vim customizations
** TODO Add vim to stow
* Ansible Profiles
** TODO Amazon Linux
** TODO MAC OSX
** TODO Debian
* TODO Figure out how I can combine multile subdirectories using stow
** Currently messing up the .config directory
* TODO Move .spacemacs to org babel
** https://github.com/ale-batt/dotspacemacs/edit/master/ale-batt.org
* TODO Secret managment
** We will have to script the injection of variables into scrips that are deployed via the main repo
** Seems like it might be hard to symlink the .ssh directory
** Get my work projects setup in spacemacs
** It seems like a good way to do this would just be with a private repo that you deploy seperatly
** get org file dir going with deft support
** The private repo this draws against could be pulled via an optional ansible call, ie deploy --secret-repo http:://somesecretrepo.com/repo
