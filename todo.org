#+TITLE: Outstanding issues and goals for the config

* NEW:
** Docker broken
** powerlevel9k is not stable enough to clone, needs to be statically linked.

* EMACS
** TODO Get org shift commands mapped to something usful
** TODO Add support for visual bookmarks
** Broken keybaord shortcuts:
*** TODO Searching
*** TODO Select all
** DONE Document org-bullets fix
   CLOSED: [2017-07-05 Wed 07:26]
** DONE Magit Theme issues

* VIM
** TODO Setup VIM Theme
** TODO Setup basic vim customizations
** TODO Add vim to stow
* Ansible Profiles
** TODO Integrate tmux 2.5
** TODO Integrate icdiff
** TODO Amazon Linux
** TODO MAC OSX
* TODO Move to a ZSH framework
* TODO Secret managment
** We will have to script the injection of variables into scrips that are deployed via the main repo
** Seems like it might be hard to symlink the .ssh directory
** Get my work projects setup in spacemacs
** It seems like a good way to do this would just be with a private repo that you deploy seperatly
** get org file dir going with deft support
** The private repo this draws against could be pulled via an optional ansible call, ie deploy --secret-repo http:://somesecretrepo.com/repo
